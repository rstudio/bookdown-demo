# Methods

We describe our methods in this chapter.

Math can be added in body using usual syntax like this 

## math example

$p$ is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard error will be approximated

$$
SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{1/3 (1 - 1/3)} {300}} = 0.027
$$

You can also use math in footnotes like this^[where we mention $p = \frac{a}{b}$].

We will approximate standard error to 0.027[^longnote]

[^longnote]: $p$ is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard error will be approximated
